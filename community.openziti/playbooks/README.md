# Ansible OpenZiti Playbooks

## OpenZiti Download Role
Playbook file : `demo_openziti_download.yaml`.

Example playbook that uses [openziti_download role](/community.openziti/roles/openziti_download).

### Sudo Password
Some tasks needs to be executed with sudo privileges when using openziti_download role, make sure you have a safe way of storing your sudo passwords.
For example, you could use `ansible-vault` and update your hosts file with the key-value `ansible_become_pass="{{ my_host_become_pass }}"`.

When using your localhost as the `cache-server` (i.e `openziti_cache_localhost` = `true`), you need sudo privileges to make sure that some packages are installed on your localhost (ref. [required_packages.yaml](/community.openziti/roles/openziti_download/tasks/required_packages.yaml)).
Either specify your localhost sudo password with `-K` or `--ask-become-pass` option, or put your password on the variable `localhost_become_pass` while making sure you're storing it in a secure way.

When using a remote host as the `cache-server` (i.e `openziti_cache_localhost` = `false`), you should provide the sudo password in host variables.

### Avoid sudo on cache_server/localhost
If you want to avoid providing become password for your cache_server or localhost, just make sure you've tar, zip and git packages installed and skip the tag `cache_server_packages` by running the playbook with `--skip-tags cache_server_packages`.
