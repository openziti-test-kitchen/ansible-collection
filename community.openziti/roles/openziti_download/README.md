# OpenZiti Download
This role downloads the OpenZiti binaries from Github releases and puts each Ziti component (controller, edge, tunnel, etc) on the appropriate host using host's group name.

The role is idempotent, so it can be easily used with AWX.

## TODO :
- Find a way to support specific version download from Ziti Console
- Maybe set OpenZiti components in host vars and not host groups
- Support version upgrades

## Usage

### Sudo Password
Some tasks needs to be executed with sudo privileges when using openziti_download role, make sure you have a safe way of storing your sudo passwords.
For example, you could use `ansible-vault` and update your hosts file with the key-value `ansible_become_pass="{{ my_host_become_pass }}"`.

When using your localhost as the `cache-server` (i.e `openziti_cache_localhost` = `true`), you need sudo privileges to make sure that some packages are installed on your localhost (ref. [required_packages.yaml](/community.openziti/roles/openziti_download/tasks/required_packages.yaml)).
Either specify your localhost sudo password with `-K` or `--ask-become-pass` option, or put your password on the variable `localhost_become_pass` while making sure you're storing it in a secure way.

When using a remote host as the `cache-server` (i.e `openziti_cache_localhost` = `false`), you should provide the sudo password in host variables.

### Avoid sudo on cache_server/localhost
If you want to avoid providing become password for your cache_server or localhost, just make sure you've tar, zip and git packages installed and skip the tag `cache_server_packages` by running the playbook with `--skip-tags cache_server_packages`.
